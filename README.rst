We are very grateful to Allen B. Downey for his work in writing

The chapter on Algorithm Analysis was ported from one by Jan Pearce, Brad Miller, and David Ranum
for the
`Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using C++ <https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/cppds/index.html>`_

We are extremely grateful to Berea College's work program and the superb Berea College students who converted this
book to Runestone in Spring and Summer 2020 in spite of COVID-19.
