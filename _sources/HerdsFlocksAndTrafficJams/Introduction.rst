Introduction
------------

The agent-based models in the previous chapter are based on grids: the agents occupy discrete locations in two-dimensional space. In this chapter we consider agents that move is continuous space, including simulated cars on a one-dimensional highway and simulated birds in three-dimensional space.

The code for this chapter is in chap12.ipynb_, which is a Jupyter notebook in the repository for this book. For more information about working with this code, see :ref:`Section 1.4 <PF_4>`
