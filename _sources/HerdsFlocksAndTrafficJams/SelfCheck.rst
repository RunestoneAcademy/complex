   :casei:
   
   The drivers had control over one thing that eventually caused them to create the traffic jams, which was |blank|.

   - :acceleration: Correct, they had control over speed!
     :x: Incorrect, please refer to the section 11.2.

.. dragndrop:: SC11_Q2
   :match_1: Flock centering|||Move toward the center of the flock.
   :match_2: Collision avoidance|||Avoid obstacles, including other Boids.
   :match_3: Velocity Matching|||Align velocity (speed and direction) with neighboring Boids.

   Agents in the “Flocks, herds, and schools” model are called boids. Name the behaviors that each agent simulates in this model.

.. dragndrop:: SC11_Q3
    :match_1: The Rule 30 cellular automaton|||Is deterministic, and the rules that govern its evolution are completely known.
    :match_2: Schelling's model|||Are not racist, but the outcome of their interactions is a high degree of segregation
    :match_3: Sugarscape|||Agents in this model form waves that move diagonally even though they cannot do so on their own.
    :match_4: Traffic jams|||Move backward even though the cars in them are moving forward.
    :match_5: Flocks and heards|||They behave as if they are centrally organized even though the animals in them are making individual decisions based on local information.

    Many complex systems have properties as a whole that their components do not. Drag and drop the properties of single agents and the behaviors of the complex system to the correct model.
