.. fillintheblank:: SC6_Q1
   :casei:

   Several CAs are Turing complete, this means they can compute any computable function. What is this property called? |blank|

   - :universality: Correct!
     :spaceships: Incorrect, a spaceship is a structure that appear within CAs that translate in space, apperaing as diagonals with different slopes, depending on how many time steps they take to shift by one column. 
     :x: Incorrect. Please take a closer look to the properties of CAs.

.. fillintheblank:: SC6_Q2
    :casei:

    If you wanted to make a hypotheses that could never be proven wrong you would want to make a |blank| hypothesis.

    - :unfalsifiable: Correct, unfalsifiable hypoteses are impossible ot refute but are useless when you want to make reliable predicions about the wrold. 
      :falsifiable: Incorrect, falsifiable hypotheses are able to be proven or disproven. 
      :x: Incorrect, please try again.

.. mchoice:: SC6_Q3
    :answer_a: True
    :answer_b: False
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: Correct, it only obscures the difference between the essential features.
    :feedback_b: Incorrect, more realistic simple models will not become more reliable. 

    If you make a simple model more realistic it will not become more reliable.
