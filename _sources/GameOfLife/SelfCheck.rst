   :feedback_a: Incorrect, a glider gun is a pattern that will periodically produce a spaceship. 
   :feedback_b: Correct, a glider is a pattern that is back in its starting position after four steps but shifted down and to the right.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect, a toad is a pattern that will alternate between two states. 
   :feedback_d: Incorrect, gospers gun is a pattern that will peridically produce a spaceship.

   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: False
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct, the glider gun, or as it is called today Gosper's gun, is one of the two patterns Conway said would dispfrove his conjecture. 
   :feedback_b: Incorrect, 

   The Game of Life pattern that is presented in the gif above is one of the patterns that Conway said would disprove his conjecture.

   :feedback_a: Incorrect, a toad is a pattern that will alternate between two states. 
   :feedback_b: Incorrect, a glider is a pattern that is back in its starting position after four steps but shifted down and to the right.
   :feedback_c: Correct, a r-pentomino is one of the simplest patterns that fall under the methuselahs classification of patterns. Methuselahs are patterns that are long lived and have simple starting positions.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect, a puffer train is a translating pattern that leaves live cells in its wake.

   Fill in the blank with the correct Game of Life pattern:

   A |blank| is a pattern that oscillates and alternates between two states.

   - :toad: Correct.
     :Glider: Incorrect, a glider is a pattern that is back in its starting position after four steps but shifted down and to the right.
     :R-Pentomino: Incorrect,  a r-pentomino is one of the simplest patterns that fall under the methuselahs classification of patterns. Methuselahs are patterns that are long lived and have simple starting positions.
     :Puffer Train: Incorrect, a puffer train is a translating pattern that leaves live cells in its wake. 
     :Gospers Gun: Incorrect, gospers gun is a pattern that will peridically produce a spaceship.
     :Spaceship: Incorrect, a spaceship is a pattern that will oscillate and it will return to its starting position but shifted in space.
     :Beehive: Incorrect, a beehive is a stable pattern that has two or three neighbors.
     :x: Incorrect.
