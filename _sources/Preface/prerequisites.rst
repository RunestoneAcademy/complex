Prerequisites
-------------

The examples and supporting code for this book are in Python. You should know core Python and be familiar with its object-oriented features, specifically using and defining classes.

If you are not already familiar with Python, you might want to start with a Runestone
text that is appropriate for people who have never programmed before-- there are now
several good choices. If you have programming experience in another language, there are many good Python books to choose from, as well as online resources.

We will use NumPy, SciPy, and NetworkX throughout the book. If you are familiar with these libraries already, that’s great, but we will also explain them when they appear.

Some mathematics is also used. Logarithms are used in several places and vectors in one example. But that’s about it.
