.. mchoice:: SC5_Q1
   :answer_a: Low clustering and high path length.
   :answer_b: High clustering and high path length.
   :answer_c: Low clustering and low path length.
   :answer_d: High clustering and low path length.
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Not quite. Try again.
   :feedback_b: No, this would not be ideal.
   :feedback_c: No, keep trying.
   :feedback_d: Correct! In a small world graph, things are very clustered and have little space between then, hence their low path length.

   What are the characteristics of a small world graph?

.. mchoice:: SC5_Q2
   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: False
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect, a WS model can be heavy-tailed but they can never follow power law.
   :feedback_b: Correct, just because some do that does not mean all do.

   All heavy-tailed distributions follow the power law.

.. fillintheblank:: SC5_Q3
   :casei:

   According to this model,  if two things are similar in some ways, they are likely to be similar in other ways. Keeping this in mind fill in the blanks.

   **Word Bank:**

   +----------+---------+------+--------+
   |Observable|Behavior | Model| System |
   +----------+---------+------+--------+

   In a system, S, we see something |blank| , that warrants explanation.
   We construct a model, that is analogous to |blank|
   By simulation or mathematical derivation, we show that the model exhibits a |blank|
   We conclude that System exhibits Observable because System is similar to Model, Model exhibits Behavior, and |blank| is similar to |blank|
