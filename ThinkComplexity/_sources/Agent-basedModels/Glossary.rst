    Agents
        They are intended to model people and other entities that gather information about the world, make decisions, and take actions.
        The agents are usually situated in space or in a network, and interact with each other locally. They usually have imperfect or incomplete information about the world.
        Often there are differences among agents, unlike previous models where all components are identical. And agent-based models often include randomness, either among the agents or in the world.

    Agnet-Based Models
        An agent-based model is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole.

    Computationally Irreducible
        There are no shortcuts. The only way to get the outcome is to implement the system.

    Emergent Property
        It is a characteristic of a system that results from the interaction of its components, not from their properties.

    Schelling's Model
        Schelling's model is a grid where each cell represents a house. The houses are occupied by two kinds of agents, labeled red and blue, in roughly equal numbers. About 10% of the houses are empty.
        At any point in time, an agent might be happy or unhappy, depending on the other agents in the neighborhood, where the “neighborhood" of each house is the set of eight adjacent cells. In one version of the model, agents are happy if they have at least two neighbors like themselves, and unhappy if they have one or zero.

    Sugarscape
        It is an agent-based model of an “artificial society” intended to support experiments related to economics and other social sciences.
