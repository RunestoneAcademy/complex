Preface
------------
Complexity science is an interdisciplinary field — at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and natural science — that focuses on complex
systems, which are systems with many interacting components.
One of the core tools of complexity science is discrete models, including networks and graphs, cellular automatons, and agent-based simulations. These
tools are useful in the natural and social sciences, and sometimes in arts and
humanities.
For an overview of complexity science, see http://thinkcomplex.com/complex.
Why should you learn about complexity science? Here are a few reasons:
- Complexity science is useful, especially for explaining why natural and
social systems behave the way they do. Since Newton, math-based
physics has focused on systems with small numbers of components and
simple interactions. These models are effective for some applications,
like celestial mechanics, and less useful for others, like economics. Complexity science provides a diverse and adaptable modeling toolkit.
- Many of the central results of complexity science are surprising; a recurring theme of this book is that simple models can produce complicated
behavior, with the corollary that we can sometimes explain complicated
behavior in the real world using simple models.
- As I explain in Chapter 1, complexity science is at the center of a slow
shift in the practice of science and a change in what we consider science
to be.
xii Chapter 0 Preface
- Studying complexity science provides an opportunity to learn about diverse physical and social systems, to develop and apply programming
skills, and to think about fundamental questions in the philosophy of
science.

By reading this book and working on the exercises you will have a chance to
explore topics and ideas you might not encounter otherwise, practice programming in Python, and learn more about data structures and algorithms.
