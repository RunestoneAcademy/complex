**Watts-Strogatz graphs:** a random graph generation model that produces graphs with small-world properties, including short average path lengths and high clustering.

**Regular graphs:** in a regular graph every node has the same number of neighbors.

**Clustering:** a measure of the “cliquishness” of the graph

**Path length:** a measure of the average distance between two nodes

**Clique:** a set of nodes that are completely connected; that is, there are edges between all pairs of nodes in the set.

**Generative model:** tries to explain a phenomenon by modeling the process that builds or leads to the phenomenon.

**Degree:** the number of neighbors

**Clustering coefficient:** a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.

**Dijkstra’s algorithm:** solves the “single source shortest path problem”, which means that it finds the minimum distance from a given “source” node to every other node in the graph (or at least every connected node).

**Queue:** a data structure in which elements are removed in the same order they were entered.
