   :match_4: Path length|||Measure of the average distance between two nodes
   :match_5: Clique|||A set of nodes that are completely connected.
   :match_6: Generative model|||Modeling the process that builds or leads to the phenomenon to try and explain a phenomenon.
   :match_7: Degree|||The number of neighbors.
   :match_8: Clustering coefficient|||The measure of the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together in a graph.
