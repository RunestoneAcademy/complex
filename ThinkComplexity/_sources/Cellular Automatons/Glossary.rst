**Cellular automaton (CA):** is a model of a world with very simple physics. “Cellular” means that the world is divided into discrete chunks, called cells. An “automaton” is a machine that performs computations — it could be a real machine, but more often the “machine” is a mathematical abstraction or a computer simulation.

**Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs):** Programs that produce random-seeming numbers 

**Turing complete:** means that they can compute any computable function. Universality

**Cross-correlation:** selecting elements from an array and adding them up
