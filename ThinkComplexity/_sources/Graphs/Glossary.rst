**Graph:**  a graph is a representation of a system that contains discrete, interconnected elements. 

**Nodes:**  a node represents the information contained in a single data structure. These nodes may contain a value or condition, or possibly serve as another independent data structure. **Vertices**
 
**Edges:**  an edge of a network is one of the connections between the nodes (or vertices) of the network.

**Directed graph:**  a directed graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another.

**Undirected graph:**  an undirected graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional.

**Graph Theory:**  graph theory is the study of graphs, a mathematical structure used to model pair wise relations between objects from a certain collection. A graph in this context refers to a collection of vertices or nodes and a collection of ed

**Graph algorithm:**   a graph algorithmis an algorithm that takes one or more graphsas inputs

**Path:**  a path is a sequence of nodes with an edge between each consecutive pair.
  
**NetworkX:**  networkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks

**Random graph:**   a graph with nodes and edges generated at random.

**Complete graph:**  a complete graph is a graph where every node is connected to every other.

**Connected graphs:** a graph is connected if there is a path from every node to every other node

**Stack:** a stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) in which elements are added or removed from the top of the stack, in a “last in first, first out” or LIFO order.

**ER graphs:** the ER model is either of two closely related models for generating random graphs. The ER graph G(n, p) contains n nodes, and each pair of nodes is connected by an edge with probability p.
