.. glossary::

    abstraction
        focusing on desired behaviors and properties while disregarding what is irrelevant/unimportant

    access keywords
        keywords such as ''public'', private'', and ''protected'' that indicates what class properties/behaviors a user can change

    address-of
        The address-of operator (``&``) is used to access the address of a C++ variable.

    argument
        data passed to a parameter.

    array
        a data structure consisting of an ordered collection of data elements of identical type in which each element can be identified by an array index.

    atomic data type
        basic data type that cannot be broken down into any simpler data elements.

    ``bool``
        keyword for Boolean data type.

    ``char``
        keyword for character data type that stores a single character.

    class
        a template for creating (instantiating) objects, for providing initial values for state via member variables, and for implementations of behavior via member functions or methods

    class methods
        the functions and methods that belong to a class that describe what the class can do

    collection
        a grouping of a number of data items (possibly only zero or one) that have some shared significance or need to be operated upon together.

    ``const``
        keyword that makes a variable or value immutable. i.e. constant and unchanging.

    constructor
        an class' special function that initializes an object of that class

    dereference
        follow a pointer to its referenced memory location and read the data there.

    ``double``
        keyword for double-precision floating point data type.

    encapsulation
        hiding the contents of a class except when absolutely necessary

    ``float``
        keyword for floating point data type.

    friend
        an operator or function that can access the private data members of a class of which it is designated as a friend.

    friend function
        a function defined outside that class' scope but has access to private and protected members of the class

    function
        A section of code that performs a procedure and is usually named.

    hash table
        a collection consisting of key-value pairs with an associated hash function that maps the key to the associated value.

    immutable
        unable to be modified.

    inheritance
        sharing/gaining the same behavior as another class

    instance
        an occurrence of an object

    ``int``
        keyword for integer data type.

    mutability
        able to be modified.

    object
        an abstraction of that can contain data as well as manipulate data

    object attribute
        a property of an object that describes what it "looks like"

    object-oriented programming language
        programming language that uses objects to represent data and methods such as C++ and Java

    overloading
        specifying more than one definition for the same function name or the same operator within the same scope.

    parameter
        a variable in a function or method definition that accepts data passed from an argument.

    pointer
        a variable that stores and manipulates memory addresses.

    polymorphism
        the ability to process objects or methods differently depending on their data type, class, number of arguments, etc.

    reference
        a value that indicates a place in a computerâ€™s memory.

    set
        an unordered data structure consisting of unique, immutable data values.

    string
        a sequential data structure consisting of zero or more characters.

    vector
        sequence container storing data of a single type that is stored in a dynamically allocated array which can change in size.

    ``void``
        keyword indicating a function has no return value.

    word
        unit of data used by a particular processor design.
