Summary
-------

-  Computer science is the study of problem solving.

-  Computer science uses abstraction as a tool for representing both
   processes and data.

-  Abstract data types allow programmers to manage the complexity of a
   problem domain by hiding the details of the data.

-  C++ is a powerful object-oriented language.

- All variables must be declared before use in C++.

- C++ has typical built-in numeric types: ``int`` is for integers and ``float`` and ``double`` are used for floating point depending on the number of digits desired.

- C++ has the Boolean type ``bool`` that holds ``true`` or ``false``.

- The character data type ``char`` holds a single character which is encased in single quotes.

- Pointers are a type of variable that stores a memory address. To declare a pointer, an  ``*`` is used before the variable name that is supposed to store the location.

-  A statically allocated C++ array is an ordered collection of one or more C++ data values of identical type stored in contiguous memory.

-  A vector is a dynamically allocated array with many useful methods.

-  C++ strings are a sequential collection of zero or more characters.

-  A hash table is used to store keys-value pairs. It applies a related hash function to the key in order to compute the location of the associated value. Look-up is typically very fast.

-  A set is an unordered collection of unique values.

-  Arrays, vectors, and strings are C++ sequential collections.

-  Hash tables and sets are nonsequential collections of data.

-  In C++, a function definition requires a name, a group of parameters, a return type, and a body.

-  Non-fruitful functions in C++ must contain the keyword ``void`` in its function definition.

-  You can pass variables by value as well as by reference in C++ functions. Passing by reference utilizes the use of pointers.

-  Pass by reference is useful when you require a function to return multiple variables.

-  To pass an array to a function you need to use an array parameter. The array parameter is denoted by the array variable name followed by set of square brackets ([ and ]).

-  Defining a new meaning for an already existing operator (such as the arithmetic operators plus “+” or times “*”) is called overloading the operator. The operators ::, #, ., and ? are reserved and cannot be overloaded.

-  Some operators such as =, [], () and -> can only be overloaded as member functions of a class and not as global functions.

-  Classes allow programmers to implement abstract data types.

-  Programmers can override standard methods as well as create new
   methods.

-  Classes can be organized into hierarchies.

-  A class constructor should always invoke the constructor of its
   parent before continuing on with its own data and behavior.
